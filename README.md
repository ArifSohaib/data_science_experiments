I will post random data science experiments I do in this repo

#Experiment 1:
sentiment analysis using Twitter API and TextBlob 
Did this for the sirajology sentiment analysis challange.
###Note: 
Since this just uses a bag of words model, the results may not be very accurate
###Note:
To run this experiment, you need to add your twitter api keys to another file and name the file ```access_api.py```
and the variables: ```consumer_key```,```consumer_secret```, ```access_token``` and ```access_token_secret```.
These variables need to be hidden from public view as anyone who knows can access the twitter api as you and cause problems, the simplest of which is overlaoding your twitter developer account's number of free api requests.
