I will post random data science experiments I do in this repo

#Experiment 1:
sentiment analysis using Twitter API and TextBlob 
Did this for the sirajology sentiment analysis challange.
###Note: 
Since this just uses a bag of words model, the results may not be very accurate
###Note:
To run this experiment, you need to add your twitter api keys to another file and name the file ```access_api.py```
and the variables: ```consumer_key```,```consumer_secret```, ```access_token``` and ```access_token_secret```.
