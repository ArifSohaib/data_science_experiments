# data_science_experiments
I will post random data science experiments I do in this repo

#Experiment 1:
sentiment analysis using Twitter API and TextBlob 
Did this for the sirajology sentiment analysis challange.
###Note: 
Since this just uses a bag of words model, the results may not be very accurate
